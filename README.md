# Advent of Code Solutions

## About the Project

This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that follow an advent calendar format, where a new challenge is unlocked each day.

## Structure

Each day's challenge is organized in a separate directory following the year/day format. For example, the solution for Day 1 of the year 2023 is located in the directory 2023/1/.

## Directory Layout

- 2023/1/: Contains the code and Makefile for Day 1.
- 2023/2/: Contains the code and Makefile for Day 2.
- ... and so on for each day of the challenges.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed, as the solutions are implemented in C.

Clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/newbee1905/adventofcode
cd adventofcode
```

### Building and Running Solutions

#### To build all solutions

```bash
make all
```

#### To run a specific day's solution (e.g., Day 1 of 2023)
